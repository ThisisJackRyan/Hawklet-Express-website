# Hawklet-Express-website

My School is opening a Breakfeast Cafe. I decided to make a website for it so that online orders can be taken. 
To view the current State of the website click the link:

This website is made using Html, JavaScript, and Css. The Hawklet Express website was my first big web project that catapulted me into my interest of web design. I made in congruencey with my Webpage design class. I also presented this to my class and each time they would critique and help me make a better version. This was my final version when the semester ended and to veiw it I have a gh-pages set up on my github. 

 
I am using the font Jupiter Pro. Which is Rockhurst Highschools Font. The only issue is that the "A" doesn't have the middle cross bar. I fixed it by using the lower case alpha "Î±". This doesn't always work on all devices for some reason. I would change the font but this is what my teacher said looked best for Rockhurst. 

To use the Website effectively make a Account that is saved to local Storage

                The Hawklet Express is aimed to unite the Rockhurst community by providing an opportunity to serve fellow students, and provides a time for all students to socialize with each other. Our business plan is focused on our drive to create and sustain a welcoming and joyful environment for students, staff, alumni, and visitors within our school.

                <div class="title flex center aboutTitle"><span>Origin</span></div>
                <div class="align flex center middle pad">Our team originates from Mr. Bakers Entrepreneurship for Others class offered here at Rockhurst high school. We all attended Mr. Baker's class in the first semester or are involved in the Entrepreneurship Club, also offered here at Rockhurst high school. Our team shared a common drive and desire to improve the morning environment for the Rockhurst community through the Hawklet Express.

                <div class="title flex center aboutTitle"><span>Our Structure</span></div>
                <div class="align flex center middle pad">The Student Members will be in two groups. One group is a small team that will be incharge of the administration side ie: Pricing, Funding, Revenue, Website.
                    The other group will be a larger group incharge of everyday operations. They will help with the administration side but get a more physical hands on experience of the company. 
                    Rockhurst Students are already super busy by dividing up the running of the shop and managing we will be able to include more people into the Hawklet Express and use everyone's agilities to maximize the quality of the cafe. 
                    </div>
                        <div class="align flex center middle pad">The adult teams are established to give aid and mentorship to the students but generally remain hands off. The Adult Mentors will typically act as a facilitator between the students and School Administrator.
